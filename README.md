## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utkarshgupta04092003/clerk-user-management-app.git
   cd clerk-user-management-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you're using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Clerk**:

   To integrate Clerk authentication into your project, follow these steps:

   1. Sign up for an account at [Clerk](https://clerk.dev).
   2. Create a new Clerk application in the Clerk dashboard.
   3. Once your app is created, you'll get the necessary Clerk API keys.

4. **Create a `.env.local` file**:

   Add the following environment variables to the `.env.local` file at the root of the project:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-publishable-api-key>
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   ```

   Replace `<your-publishable-api-key>` and `<your-secret-key>` with the actual values from your Clerk application.

5. **Run the development server**:

   After configuring Clerk, start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or if you're using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Open the application**:

   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

## Authentication Flow

- The app integrates Clerk's authentication flow, which includes Sign-in and Sign-up pages provided by Clerk.
- You can easily add protected routes by using Clerk's middleware or components to restrict access to authenticated users.

## Clerk Setup

Clerk provides easy-to-use authentication components, such as:

- **`SignIn` Component**: Displays a sign-in form.
- **`SignUp` Component**: Displays a sign-up form.
- **`UserButton` Component**: Displays the current userâ€™s profile and sign-out options.

You can customize these components or integrate them into your custom routes.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { SignIn, SignUp, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// Sign-in form
<SignIn />;

// Sign-up form
<SignUp />;

// User profile and sign-out
<UserButton />;
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run start`**: Starts the production build.
